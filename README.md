# ⚠️Not updated to last twitter API version⚠️

# CryptoPriceTwitterBot
Open-source miniproject using Twitter and CoinMarketCap APIs

The bot is pretty simple to use and it is aimed to be used as a cronjob.

Basically, you have to fill your data into the config.example.json file provided, and 
schedule the script as a cronjob.

The bot just runs once and collects and posts all the information of each one of the coins that you
have filled in the config file.

You will be able to get the "permanent" twitter tokens following the process shown in this link: https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-create-multiple-bots-with-a-single-twitter-developer-account-529eaba6a576

Have fun tweaking and modifying the bot!
